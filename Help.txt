All commands are case insensitive. 
Single command help is not available currently. 
There are a few more additional commands that are meant for administration. 
And also a few that do the same as above. Example !mor and !rev function the same as !reverse. 
The person running EBot can also chat using console 
Typing anything normally will function as a normal PRIVMSG to the current channel 
Prepending the text with a "/" will send a direct raw command
