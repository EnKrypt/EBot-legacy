An immensely fun and interesting project which I enjoyed doing.

What EBot is : 

Just a simple IRC bot made by me
Expanded on JTel , another project of mine

A CUI Version has been included after the 3.0 release to ensure compatibility over command line utilities.

LogBot v1.0 has also been added. LogBot is just an extension and a modified EBot , suited solely for logging. It logs all conversation to log.txt and does not serve any commands. Due to thae fact that this just an edited version of EBot , LogBot can have many unnecessary residue from the commands of EBot and can resemble EBot in many ways.

A Pl0 Parser has been added to EBot to increase Bot functionality. The entire Lisp code ( everything about it , standards , functions etc) are included in http://github.com/EnKrypt/JPL0
Please refer to that link for any doubts pertaining to lisp functionality of the bot

All commands are case insensitive. 
Single command help is not available currently. 
There are a few more additional commands that are meant for administration. 
And also a few that do the same as above. Example !mor and !rev function the same as !reverse. 
The person running EBot can also chat using console 
Typing anything normally will function as a normal PRIVMSG to the current channel 
Prepending the text with a "/" will send a direct raw command
